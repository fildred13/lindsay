Kate Burke signed the memo in his absence. This is a necessary practice when one of our account managers is out sick or on vacation to ensure we process authorizations in a timely manner. Your audit manager is aware of this practice, and I expect it is documented in your audit files already, but if further support is needed please let me know."</p>
